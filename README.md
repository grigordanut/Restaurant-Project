# Restaurant-Project
Developed an Android mobile application that allows the restaurateur to add the food menu, the price of food and special offers. The customers can see the food added of each restaurant with the possibility to add the food on the watching list or add the food to the buying cart. This project exposed me to the full software development lifecycle and greatly increased my understanding of using Agile Development for enhanced UX. 
Technologies used: Android, Java, JSON, XML, SQLite, NFC, and remote cloud storage.
